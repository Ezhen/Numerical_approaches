Here, all scripts built in frames of the course of Numerical Methods in Geophysics by Jean-Marie Beckers (http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/mediawiki/index.php/User:JMB) are stored.

Scripts:
* Discretization_schemes.py / Testing different 1st order discretization schemes
* Lotka_Voltera.py 	/ The examination task, the stability of the numerical solution as a function of the time step
